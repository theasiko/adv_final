# Body size estimation
Introduction 

Problem 

In the fashion industry, accurate assessment of body size estimation is of paramount importance to both consumers and retailers. With the growing popularity of online shopping, people are often faced with the challenge of finding clothing that fits well and matches their figure. Inappropriate clothing not only causes customer dissatisfaction, but also contributes to a high rate of returns, which creates additional logistical and financial challenges for retailers. Moreover, the fashion industry's impact on the environment is significant, with textile production, manufacturing, and waste contributing to pollution and resource depletion.

Integrated seamlessly into e-commerce platforms, VTO also provides valuable data insights for brands, leading to higher conversion rates and positive brand perception. Looking ahead, the future of VTO promises expanded product choices, realistic previews, social shopping experiences, improved size and fit confidence, and in-home trials with AR, empowering brands to redefine the digital retail experience and build stronger connections with customers. 

Current work (description of the work) 

Accurately estimating body sizes is crucial in both online fashion retail and traditional retail settings, as it aids in reducing returns and enhancing customer satisfaction. Our ongoing project aims to develop a specialized body size estimation system tailored for fashion purposes. To achieve this, we are collecting diverse and qualitative data by analyzing customer reviews from a variety of online stores. Our solution utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful deep learning architecture, trained on labeled datasets to precisely estimate body sizes based on the information provided in customer reviews. 

Data and Methods 

Information about the data 

For this research, a comprehensive dataset was meticulously compiled from diverse online retail platforms, encompassing a spectrum of consumer reviews. Specifically, the dataset comprises photographs depicting women's reviews across a range of apparel sizes, including XS, S, M, L, and XL. Each size category was systematically represented by a collection of 50 meticulously curated photographs, meticulously selected to ensure a balanced and representative sample. Hence, we have collected 250 photos in total. Moreover, to standardize the dataset and facilitate consistent analysis, all images were uniformly cropped to adhere to a 3:4 aspect ratio.
